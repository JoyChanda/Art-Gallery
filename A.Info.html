                    <h4><b>OUR MISSION</b></h4><br>
                    
                   <h1> Our journey starts with U.</h1><br>

                    Since the gallery's inception in September 2013,
                     Unit London has established itself as a global artistic platform for the world’s most distinctive talent.
                      In an often opaque and unaccommodating art market,
                       Unit London has sought to identify,
                        cultivate and expose works of art on a meritocratic basis.
                         The gallery has successfully launched and advanced the careers of numerous important
                          contemporary artists and remains firmly committed to its driving principles of equity,
                           innovation and accessibility.

                    The gallery is forthright in its dedication to be an open and transparent institution at the forefront of an expanding and diversifying art industry.
                     As a consequence of its boldly independent approach to the gallery model, 
                     Unit London has become synonymous with a pioneering use of social media and digital content.
                      The gallery endeavours to act as a platform; a stage upon which the stories of today’s most gifted artists can be told,
                       whilst bridging the gap between the physical and virtual spheres of modern experience; connecting people with the art they love.

                    In actively engaging with its growing audience of millions worldwide,
                     the gallery hopes to carve out a more significant role for the creative 
                     and visual arts in the future of our societies - firmly believing that mass engagement with art
                      can play a critical role in cultivating creative thought. A more creative world will be better placed to solve the significant
                       challenges it will face in the future. Championing art and creativity to the broadest possible audience is, and will continue to be,
                        the gallery's core, driving mission.<br><br><br><br><br>

                         <h4><b>OUR FOUNDERS</b></h4><br>
                          <h1>"We were both painters so we’ve always had a real appreciation for artists working in that medium."</h1><br>

                        Unit London was founded on the enterprising spirit of close childhood friends Joe Kennedy and Jonny Burt.
                         Frustrated by the prohibitive and confounding industry mechanisms
                          that restrict broad access to the art world for artists, enthusiasts,
                           and would-be collectors alike, Joe and Jonny opened a small pop-up gallery space in an empty charity shop
                            at the ages of 22 and 23, determined to build a business that encouraged access,
                             engagement and opportunity for committed and talented artists.
                              As young gallery owners initially showing their own paintings,
                               they set out to develop a roster of international artists that embodied a shifting global culture of information
                                sharing and global connectivity. The pair were, and are, uniquely placed to influence the evolution
                                 of the art industry and play a significant part in realigning
                                  its ingrained value systems through the relentless and purposeful
                                   championing of exceptional artist talent. 

                                Today, Joe and Jonny lead a diverse and multi-talented team of individuals
                                 in their London gallery who share in the mission of supporting the world's most exciting artists,
                                  and making their work accessible to the widest possible
                                   audience - in the ultimate pursuit of making art a more practical and valuable
                                    aspect of our world's cultures and societies. <br><br>

					<h4>Art Gallery</h4>
					<p>Art galleries need to have enough space to hold several collections of art <br> for show as well as in storage if possible.<br>
					   Don't forget you need to be able to host receptions.<br>
					  That means a space large enough that allows people to socialize and move around.<br>
